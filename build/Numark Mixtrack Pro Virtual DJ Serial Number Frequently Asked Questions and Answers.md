If you have purchased a Numark Mixtrack Pro controller that comes with a free version of Virtual DJ LE software, you might be wondering how to find and activate your serial number. Here are some steps to help you get started:
 
1. Locate your product's serial number. All Numark products have a 17 digit serial number beginning with (21). When entering your serial number during product registration or authorization, be sure to use all caps, no spaces, and include (21). For example: (21)N11005306520514. On most Numark products, the serial can be found on the rear or bottom of the unit[^1^].
2. Go to [https://www.virtualdj.com/le/](https://www.virtualdj.com/le/) and enter your product's serial number. You will be directed to create an account or log in to an existing one.
3. Once you have logged in, you will see a download link for Virtual DJ LE. Download and install the software on your computer.
4. Launch Virtual DJ LE and enter your product's serial number again when prompted. You should see a message that says "Thank you for registering". You can now use Virtual DJ LE with your Numark Mixtrack Pro controller.
