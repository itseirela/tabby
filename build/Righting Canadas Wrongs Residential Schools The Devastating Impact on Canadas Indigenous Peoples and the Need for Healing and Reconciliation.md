Canada is often seen as a land of peace, diversity and multiculturalism. But behind this image lies a dark and shameful history of oppression and abuse of the Indigenous peoples who lived on this land long before the arrival of European settlers. One of the most tragic and devastating examples of this history is the residential school system, which aimed to assimilate and erase the culture, language and identity of Indigenous children by forcibly removing them from their families and communities and placing them in institutions where they faced physical, sexual, emotional and spiritual abuse.

## What is Righting Canada's Wrongs: Residential Schools?
  
*Righting Canada's Wrongs: Residential Schools* is a book written by Melanie Florence, a Canadian author of Cree and Scottish heritage. The book is part of a series called *Righting Canada's Wrongs*, which aims to educate young readers about the historical injustices and human rights violations that have been committed against various groups of people in Canada, such as the Chinese, the Japanese, the Acadians and the Africville residents.
  
The book focuses on the residential school system, which was established by the Canadian government and run by various Christian churches from the late 1800s to the late 1900s. The book explains how the system was based on the belief that Indigenous peoples were inferior and savage and needed to be civilized and Christianized. The book also describes how the system violated the rights and dignity of Indigenous children by separating them from their families and communities, forcing them to adopt a foreign language and culture, forbidding them to practice their own traditions and beliefs, subjecting them to harsh discipline and punishment, exposing them to disease and malnutrition, and allowing them to suffer physical, sexual, emotional and spiritual abuse at the hands of their teachers and staff.
  
The book also tells the stories of some of the survivors and their descendants who have shared their experiences and testimonies about the residential school system. The book shows how these stories reveal the lasting impact of the system on the lives of Indigenous peoples, such as trauma, loss of identity, intergenerational pain, addiction, suicide, violence, poverty and poor health. The book also highlights how these stories also demonstrate the resilience, courage, strength and hope of Indigenous peoples who have survived and resisted the system and who have reclaimed their culture, language and identity.
