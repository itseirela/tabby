## Step 2: Launch Red Alert 2
 
The next step is to launch Red Alert 2 on your computer. You can play it in single-player or skirmish mode. Start a new game or load an existing one. Once you are in the game, pause it and minimize it.
 
## Step 3: Launch Cheat Engine
 
The third step is to launch Cheat Engine on your computer. You will see a window like this:

Click on the computer icon on the top left corner of the window. This will open a process list. Scroll down and find the process named "game.exe". This is the process for Red Alert 2. Select it and click "Open".

Cheat Engine will now attach itself to the Red Alert 2 process. You will see a green check mark next to the process name.
 
## Step 4: Scan for Values
 
The fourth step is to scan for values that you want to change in the game. For example, if you want to change your money amount, you need to find the memory address that stores your money value in the game.
 
To do this, go back to the game and check how much money you have. For example, let's say you have $10,000. Then go back to Cheat Engine and enter "10000" in the "Value" box. Make sure the "Scan Type" is set to "Exact Value" and the "Value Type" is set to "4 Bytes". Then click "First Scan".

Cheat Engine will scan the memory of the game and find all the addresses that have the value "10000". You will see a list of addresses on the left panel of the window. However, not all of these addresses are related to your money amount. Some of them may be related to other things in the game.
 
To narrow down the list, you need to change your money amount in the game and do another scan. For example, go back to the game and spend some money or earn some money. Let's say you now have $9,500. Then go back to Cheat Engine and enter "9500" in the "Value" box. Make sure the "Scan Type" is set to "Exact Value" and the "Value Type" is set to "4 Bytes". Then click "Next Scan".
