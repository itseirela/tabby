WASP IV 64 Bit is a computer code that helps electric utility planners to find the optimal mix of power plants to meet the future electricity demand of a country or region. WASP stands for Wien Automatic System Planning, and it was originally developed by the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the USA in 1972[^2^]. Since then, it has been updated and improved by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and some of its Member States to address new challenges and issues in the electric power sector[^2^].
 
WASP IV 64 Bit can handle different types of power plants, such as thermal, hydro, nuclear, wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal, and can consider various constraints, such as fuel availability, environmental emissions, transmission capacity, reliability requirements, and load duration curves[^2^]. WASP IV 64 Bit can also perform sensitivity and risk analyses to evaluate the impact of uncertainties and variations in key parameters on the optimal expansion plan[^2^].

WASP IV 64 Bit is designed to run on Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux operating systems. It requires a 64-bit processor and at least 4 GB of RAM. The installation files can be downloaded from the IAEA website[^1^], along with the user manual, documentation, example files, and video tutorials. WASP IV 64 Bit is available to IAEA Member States that have the necessary analytical and computer capabilities[^2^].
 
WASP IV 64 Bit is a powerful tool for power generation expansion planning that can help electric utility planners to find the most economical and environmentally sound solutions for meeting the future electricity needs of their countries or regions.
  
Some of the benefits of using WASP IV 64 Bit are:
 
- It can handle complex and realistic scenarios of power generation expansion planning, such as multiple time periods, multiple regions, multiple fuels, multiple technologies, and multiple environmental objectives[^2^].
- It can perform trade-off analyses between different criteria, such as cost, reliability, emissions, fuel diversity, and energy security[^2^].
- It can link with other models, such as hydrodynamic, sediment transport, watershed, and water quality models, to provide more accurate and comprehensive inputs and outputs[^1^] [^2^].
- It can run on different operating systems and platforms, such as Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux, with a user-friendly interface and a data preprocessor[^1^].
- It can provide graphical and tabular outputs of the optimal expansion plan and its performance indicators, as well as sensitivity and risk analysis results[^2^].

WASP IV 64 Bit is a valuable tool for power generation expansion planning that can support decision making and policy formulation in the electric power sector.
  
In conclusion, WASP IV 64 Bit is a powerful and versatile tool for power generation expansion planning that can help electric utility planners to find the optimal mix of power plants to meet the future electricity demand of a country or region. WASP IV 64 Bit can handle different types of power plants, different types of constraints, different types of scenarios, and different types of analyses. WASP IV 64 Bit can also link with other models to provide more accurate and comprehensive inputs and outputs. WASP IV 64 Bit can run on different operating systems and platforms, and provide graphical and tabular outputs of the optimal expansion plan and its performance indicators. WASP IV 64 Bit is a valuable tool for decision making and policy formulation in the electric power sector.
