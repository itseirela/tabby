# How to Activate Office 2010 Professional Plus with a Serial Key
 
If you have installed Office 2010 Professional Plus on your computer, you may need to activate it with a serial key to use all its features. A serial key is a 25-character code that verifies that your copy of Office is genuine and not pirated. You can find your serial key on the product packaging or in the confirmation email if you bought Office online. Alternatively, you can use a generic volume license key (GVLK) that is provided by Microsoft for volume activation.

Volume activation is a method that allows you to activate multiple copies of Office with a single product key. This is useful for organizations that have many computers that need Office installed. To use volume activation, you need to connect to a Key Management Service (KMS) server that is hosted by Microsoft or by your organization. A KMS server can activate Office 2010 clients for 180 days, after which they need to renew their activation.
 
In this article, we will show you how to activate Office 2010 Professional Plus with a serial key or a GVLK using the KMS server method. Follow these steps:
 
1. Open any Office 2010 application, such as Word or Excel.
2. Click on the File tab and select Help.
3. Under Product Activation, click on Change Product Key.
4. Enter your serial key or a GVLK for Office 2010 Professional Plus. You can find a list of GVLKs in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alvolalex/ms_office_gvlk) [^1^] or in the [Gist page](https://gist.github.com/jerodg/502bd80a715347662e79af526c98f187) [^3^] by alvolalex and jerodg respectively. For example, the GVLK for Office 2010 Professional Plus is VYBBJ-TRJPB-QFQRF-QFT4D-H3GVB.
5. Click on Install Now and wait for the installation to complete.
6. Open a command prompt as an administrator. You can do this by clicking on the Start button, typing cmd in the search box, right-clicking on cmd.exe and selecting Run as administrator.
7. Type the following command to set the KMS server address. You can use any public or private KMS server that is available online. For example, you can use kms8.msguides.com as shown below.
`cscript "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office14\ospp.vbs" /sethst:kms8.msguides.com`
8. Type the following command to activate Office 2010 Professional Plus.
`cscript "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office14\ospp.vbs" /act`
9. You should see a message that says "Product activation successful". You can also check the activation status by opening any Office 2010 application and clicking on File > Help.

Congratulations! You have successfully activated Office 2010 Professional Plus with a serial key or a GVLK using the KMS server method. You can now enjoy all the features of Office 2010 without any limitations.
  
## Troubleshooting Office 2010 Activation Issues
 
Sometimes, you may encounter some errors or issues when trying to activate Office 2010 Professional Plus with a serial key or a GVLK using the KMS server method. Here are some common problems and their solutions:

- If you see an error message that says "The Software Licensing Service reported that the product key is invalid", it means that you have entered an incorrect serial key or GVLK. Make sure that you have typed the key correctly and that it matches the version of Office 2010 that you have installed.
- If you see an error message that says "The Software Licensing Service reported that the product cannot be activated. No Key Management Service (KMS) could be contacted", it means that your computer cannot connect to the KMS server. Make sure that you have internet access and that the KMS server address is correct. You can also try to ping the KMS server to see if it is reachable. For example, you can type `ping kms8.msguides.com` in the command prompt and see if you get a reply.
- If you see an error message that says "The Software Licensing Service reported that the product could not be activated. The count reported by your Key Management Service (KMS) is insufficient", it means that the KMS server does not have enough activation requests to activate your Office 2010. This usually happens when the KMS server is new or has low traffic. You can try to wait for a few hours or days and try again, or use a different KMS server.
- If you see an error message that says "The Software Licensing Service reported that the product was activated but the owner should verify the Product Use Rights", it means that your Office 2010 has been activated but you may not have the right to use it. This usually happens when you use a GVLK that is meant for volume licensing customers and not for individual users. You should check the terms and conditions of your Office 2010 license and make sure that you are using it legally.

If none of these solutions work for you, you can contact Microsoft support or visit their [official website](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/activate-office-2010-1fe7340c-50e2-458f-8677-f57f5a140f46)  for more help.
