If you have ETKA 7.3 installed on your Windows 64 bit system, you may want to update it to the latest version to get the most accurate and comprehensive information. However, updating ETKA 7.3 can be tricky and may require some technical skills and tools. In this article, we will show you how to install ETKA 7.3 updates from 938 to 949 on your Windows 64 bit system step by step.
 
## Step 1: Download ETKA 7.3 Updates
 
The first thing you need to do is to download the ETKA 7.3 updates from a reliable source. You can find them on various websites and forums, but make sure they are safe and virus-free. Alternatively, you can use a torrent client to download them from a trusted peer-to-peer network.
 
The ETKA 7.3 updates are divided into several files, each corresponding to a different update number. You need to download all the files from 938 to 949 in order to install them correctly. The file names should look something like this:
 
- ETKA\_7\_3\_2012\_03\_938.exe
- ETKA\_7\_3\_2012\_04\_939.exe
- ETKA\_7\_3\_2012\_05\_940.exe
- ETKA\_7\_3\_2012\_06\_941.exe
- ETKA\_7\_3\_2012\_07\_942.exe
- ETKA\_7\_3\_2012\_08\_943.exe
- ETKA\_7\_3\_2012\_09\_944.exe
- ETKA\_7\_3\_2012\_10\_945.exe
- ETKA\_7\_3\_2012\_11\_946.exe
- ETKA\_7\_3\_2012\_12\_947.exe
- ETKA\_Update\_VW\_AU\_SE\_SK\_V1-949.exe

Once you have downloaded all the files, you need to extract them using a software like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You should get a folder with the same name as the file for each update.
 
## Step 2: Run ETKA 7.3 Updates
 
The next thing you need to do is to run the ETKA 7.3 updates one by one in ascending order. You need to have administrator rights on your system to do this. To run an update, simply double-click on the executable file inside the corresponding folder.
 
A window will pop up asking you to confirm the installation path of ETKA 7.3 on your system. The default path is C:\ETKA\ but you can change it if you have installed ETKA 7.3 in a different location. Click OK to proceed.
 
The update will then start copying and replacing files in your ETKA 7.3 folder. This may take some time depending on the size of the update and the speed of your system. Do not interrupt or close the window until the update is finished.
