## Method 1: Using Microsoft Flight Simulator
 
One way to play Medicopter 117 PC game is to use Microsoft Flight Simulator, a realistic and immersive flight simulation software that allows you to fly various aircrafts in different scenarios. Microsoft Flight Simulator has a large community of modders who create custom content for the game, such as new aircrafts, liveries, sceneries, and missions. One of these mods is the H135 Medicopter 117[^1^], which adds the Medicopter 117 helicopter and its livery to the game.
 
To use this method, you will need to have Microsoft Flight Simulator installed on your PC. You can buy it from the official website or from Steam. You will also need to download the H135 Medicopter 117 mod from Flightsim.to[^1^], a website that hosts various mods for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Here are the steps to download and play Medicopter 117 PC game using Microsoft Flight Simulator:
 
1. Download the H135 Medicopter 117 mod from Flightsim.to[^1^]. You will get a ZIP file containing the mod files.
2. Extract the ZIP file to your Microsoft Flight Simulator Community folder. The location of this folder depends on where you installed the game. For example, if you installed it from Steam, it might be in C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft Flight Simulator\Packages\Community.
3. Launch Microsoft Flight Simulator and select World Map from the main menu.
4. Select any airport as your departure point and any aircraft as your default plane.
5. Click on Fly to start the flight.
6. Once you are in the cockpit, press CTRL+E to start the engine.
7. Press ALT+TAB to switch to your desktop and open the H135 Helionix mod app. This app allows you to control various aspects of the helicopter, such as autopilot, navigation, radio, etc.
8. Select H135 Medicopter 117 from the dropdown menu at the top left corner of the app.
9. Switch back to Microsoft Flight Simulator and enjoy flying the Medicopter 117 helicopter.

## Method 2: Using Medicotper 117 2 Bootleg Version
 
Another way to play Medicopter 117 PC game is to use a bootleg version called Medicotper 117 2. This is a standalone game that does not require any flight simulator software. However, this game is not an official product of the TV series or its creators. It is a Russian bootleg version that has low-quality graphics, sound, and gameplay. It also has some bugs and glitches that might affect your experience. Therefore, we do not recommend this method unless you are desperate to play Medicopter 117 PC game and cannot use Method 1.
 
To use this method, you will need to download Medicotper 117 2 from Internet Archive[^2^], a website that preserves various digital content. Here are the steps to download and play Medicopter 117 PC game using Medicotper 117 2 bootleg version:

1. Download Medicotper 117 2 from Internet Archive[^2^]. You will get an ISO file containing the game files.
2. Mount the ISO file using a virtual drive software such as Daemon Tools or PowerISO.
3. Open the mounted drive and run Setup.exe to install the 8cf37b1e13
