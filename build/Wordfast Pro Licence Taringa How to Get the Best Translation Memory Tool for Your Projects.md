## Wordfast Pro Features
 
Wordfast Pro has many features that make it a powerful and versatile translation memory tool. Here are some of the main features that you can benefit from when using Wordfast Pro:
 
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Wordfast Pro is the only major commercial TM tool on the market that runs natively on Windows, Mac, and Linux. This means you can use Wordfast Pro on any computer without compatibility issues or performance loss.
- **WYSIWYG Interface:** Wordfast Pro offers users the ability to choose either a tag mark-up editor or WYSIWIG (what you see is what you get) editor based on personal preference. The WYSIWIG editor allows you to see the layout and formatting of your source and target files as you translate, while the tag mark-up editor gives you more control over the tags and placeholders in your files.
- **Target-only Live Preview:** After translating your document, you can proofread a target-only version with layout and formatting in Wordfast Pro. You can also click on a segment in the preview that you need to change and you will be brought directly to the segment in the bilingual TXLF file for faster editing.
- **Segment Filtering:** Wordfast Pro allows you to filter segments based on terms, regular expressions, match scores, notes, and other attributes. This helps you focus on specific segments that need your attention or that match certain criteria.
- **Multilingual Translation Projects:** Wordfast Pro allows you to configure a multilingual translation package when you need to translate into multiple target languages. The project can then be sent as a single package or separate packages based on language pairs. There are no language limits or restrictions in the licensed version (the demo version is limited to bilingual projects).
