The film focuses on the lives and struggles of three INA officers - Colonel Prem Sahgal, Colonel Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon and Major Shah Nawaz Khan - who were charged with treason and waging war against the British Empire during World War 2. The film also portrays the role of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, the founder of the INA, and Captain Lakshmi Sahgal, the leader of the women's wing of the INA.
 
Raag Desh is a film that celebrates the spirit of patriotism and the sacrifice of the INA soldiers who fought for India's freedom. The film showcases the historic Red Fort trials that paved the way for India's independence and inspired millions of Indians. The film also features some patriotic songs composed by Rana Mazumder, Ram Singh Thakuri and Siddharth Pandit.
 
Raag Desh is a film that every Indian should watch to learn about the forgotten heroes of the INA and their contribution to the freedom movement. The film is available for free download in MP4 format on various websites. However, we urge you to watch the film legally on Rajya Sabha TV's YouTube channel or other streaming platforms.
  
The INA was a revolutionary force that challenged the British colonial rule in India. The INA was inspired by the vision of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, who believed that an armed struggle was the only way to achieve India's independence. Bose was a charismatic leader who mobilized the Indian expatriates and prisoners of war in Southeast Asia to join the INA. He also established a provisional government of free India in Singapore, which was recognized by Japan and other Axis powers.
 
The INA fought bravely against the British and Commonwealth forces in Burma and India. The INA's most notable campaigns were the Battle of Imphal and Kohima, where they attempted to invade India from the east. The INA also participated in the Battle of Ngakyedauk, where they captured an important airfield from the British. The INA also had a women's regiment, named after Rani of Jhansi, which was led by Captain Lakshmi Sahgal. The women soldiers of the INA were trained in combat and espionage skills.
 
The INA's fate was sealed by the defeat of Japan in World War 2. The INA surrendered to the British in 1945 and many of its members were taken as prisoners. The British decided to put on trial three senior officers of the INA - Colonel Prem Sahgal, Colonel Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon and Major Shah Nawaz Khan - for treason and waging war against the king. The trials, held at the Red Fort in Delhi, sparked a massive public outcry and support for the INA. The trials also exposed the rifts within the Indian National Congress, which had a divided opinion on the INA. The trials ultimately led to the release of the INA officers and contributed to the weakening of the British hold on India.
