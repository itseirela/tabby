One of the mods that many players enjoy is the Fallout 4 High Heels Mod, which adds a system that allows female characters to wear high heels shoes in the game. This mod not only makes the shoes look more realistic and stylish, but also adjusts the height and posture of the characters accordingly. The mod also supports different body types, such as CBBE or Fusion Girl, and works with many other clothing mods that use the same system.
 
In this article, we will show you how to install and use the Fallout 4 High Heels Mod, as well as some of the best high heels mods that you can download and try. Follow these steps to get started:
 
1. Download and install Fallout 4 High Heels System from Nexus Mods. This is the base mod that enables the high heels functionality in the game. You will need a Nexus account to download mods from this site.
2. Download and install any high heels mods that you like from Nexus Mods or other sources. Some of the most popular ones are Nora's Secrets - A high heels pack for CBBE bodyslide, HHS True Heels for CBBE Outfits (BodySlide compatible), and Fundamental High-Heel Outfits. Make sure to read the mod descriptions and requirements carefully before installing them.
3. Run BodySlide and Outfit Studio from your Fallout 4 folder. This is a tool that allows you to customize and adjust your body shape and outfits in the game. You will need this to apply the high heels system to your chosen outfits.
4. Select your body preset and outfit from the drop-down menus on the top left corner of BodySlide. You can also use the sliders to fine-tune your body shape if you want.
5. Click on Build on the bottom right corner of BodySlide. This will create a new mesh file for your outfit that will be compatible with the high heels system.
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for any other outfits that you want to use with high heels.
7. Launch Fallout 4 and load your save game. You should now be able to equip any high heels shoes and outfits that you have installed and see them working properly in the game.

- **Craftable Nora's Secret Heels with NPC support (ESL Plugin)**: This mod is an extension of Nora's Secrets mod that allows you to craft the shoes at any armor workbench and also adds them to some NPCs in the game.
