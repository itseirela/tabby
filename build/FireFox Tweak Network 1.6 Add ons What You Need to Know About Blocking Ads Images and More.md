## How to Use Tweak Network 1.6 Add-on
 
To use the Tweak Network 1.6 add-on, follow these steps:

1. Open Firefox and click on the **Tools** menu.
2. Select **Tweak Network Settings** from the drop-down menu.
3. You will see a window with four tabs: **General**, **Pipelining**, **Cache** and **About**.

5. The **Pipelining** tab lets you enable or disable HTTP pipelining, which is a technique that allows multiple requests to be sent over a single connection without waiting for each response. This can reduce latency and improve loading speed, especially for sites with many images or scripts. You can also change the maximum number of requests per connection and the maximum number of connections per server.
6. The **Cache** tab lets you modify the size and behavior of the browser's cache, which is a temporary storage of web pages and resources that can speed up loading time for frequently visited sites. You can change the maximum amount of disk space used by the cache, the memory cache capacity, and the expiration time of cached entries.
7. The **About** tab provides some information about the add-on and its developer.
8. After you have made your desired changes, click on the **Apply Settings** button at the bottom of the window. You may need to restart Firefox for some changes to take effect.
