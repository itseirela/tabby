Peacemaker follows the story of Jessica Francis, a former mercenary who is determined to become Earth's first Peacemaker. Peacemakers are the Galactic Union's most capable enforcers and negotiators, who can resolve conflicts and prevent wars among the diverse alien species. Jessica has completed a harrowing confirmation mission, but she still has to prove herself to the Guild of Peacemakers, who doubt her abilities and loyalty.
 
Jessica's final test is to bring peace to Araf, a Dream World that is on the brink of a three-way civil war. A Dream World is a terraformed planet inhabited by multiple species living and working in harmony, but Araf is far from that. The three colonies are fighting over scarce resources and broken promises, and Jessica has to find a way to stop them before they destroy each other and the planet.
 
But Jessica is not alone in her mission. She has allies and enemies, both human and alien, who have their own agendas and secrets. She also has to deal with her own personal demons, such as her abusive ex-husband and her traumatic past. Jessica will have to use all her skills, courage, and determination to succeed as a Peacemaker, or die trying.
