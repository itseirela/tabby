# The Naked Gun Trilogy: A Hilarious Spoof of Crime Comedies
 
If you are looking for a laugh-out-loud comedy series that parodies the genre of crime and detective movies, look no further than The Naked Gun Trilogy.

(1988), The Naked Gun 2Â½: The Smell of Fear (1991), and Naked Gun 33+1â3: The Final Insult (1994). Each film follows Drebin as he tries to solve a case involving a nefarious plot, while also dealing with his romantic interest, Jane Spencer (Priscilla Presley).

The trilogy is based on the short-lived television series Police Squad!, which was created by the comedy filmmaking trio Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker. The series spoofed the conventions of police procedurals, using sight gags, wordplay, and absurd humor. The films continued this style of comedy, adding more references to popular culture and current events. The trilogy also features a supporting cast of memorable characters, such as Drebin's partner Nordberg (O.J. Simpson), his boss Ed Hocken (George Kennedy), and various villains played by Ricardo Montalban, Robert Goulet, and Fred Ward.
 
The Naked Gun Trilogy is widely regarded as one of the best comedy franchises of all time, with critics praising Nielsen's deadpan delivery and the films' clever jokes. The trilogy has also influenced many other comedies, such as Austin Powers, Hot Fuzz, and Brooklyn Nine-Nine. As of 2022, a fourth film starring Liam Neeson as Frank Drebin Jr. is in development, with Seth MacFarlane producing and co-writing. Whether you are a fan of the original series or new to the franchise, The Naked Gun Trilogy is a must-watch for anyone who loves to laugh.

- The baseball blooper reel in the first film shows a ballplayer's head coming off when he crashes into a fence. This scene is a tribute to a quote from San Diego Padres announcer Jerry Coleman: "Winfield goes back to the wall. He hits his head on the wall, and it rolls off! It's rolling all the way back to second base! This is a terrible thing for the Padres."
- The breasts that remind Frank of his ex-wife in the first film are concrete reactor containment domes at San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, California.
- The joke of Frank getting hit in the face by a batter's swing in the first film was suggested by Mel Brooks.
- Ricardo Montalban was cast as the main antagonist Vincent Ludwig in the first film due to his performance as Khan Noonien Singh in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982).
- Several years after the first film, Queen Elizabeth II attended a Oakland A's versus Baltimore Orioles game in Baltimore, Maryland, and met both teams in their respective dugouts. Reggie Jackson, then an Oakland A's coach, was the first person in the receiving line in the Oakland dugout. Some news channels showed gag footage from this movie of the Queen's impersonator throwing out the first pitch.
- The flashback scene from Frank and Jane's wedding in the third film was the real ending for The Naked Gun 2Â½: The Smell of Fear (1991). They didn't use it on that movie, but inserted the scene on this one.
- On the day of shooting the 1970s flashback shoot-out in the third film, George Kennedy had come down with pneumonia. He was so ill that he couldn't even walk. To make sure the scene was shot, director Peter Segal had Kennedy sit on a bar stool for his entire part in the scene. Notice when Frank meets Ed, Ed never gets up from his stool.
- This was O.J. Simpson's final movie role. He won a Golden Raspberry for Worst Supporting Actor for this movie, presumably because of his murder trial, which started the following year.
- The cover of the issue of Playboy Magazine that Papshmir (Raye Birk) was reading in his Learjet in the third film featured Anna Nicole Smith (Tanya Peters).
- In the early 2000s, David Zucker and Pat Proft wrote a script for a fourth Naked Gun movie, with the working title "The Naked Gun 444.4," which would have given Drebin a younger, female sidekick. However, Zucker and Proft instead ended up working on Scary Movie 3 (2003), Scary Movie 4 (2006), and Scary Movie V (2013).

These are just some of the many trivia and facts about The Naked Gun Trilogy that show how much fun and creativity went into making these films.
